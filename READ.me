This project aims to direct electric vehicle users in Istanbul to the most suitable charging stations. The most suitable matches are made with a genetic algorithm by taking into account the location of the users, the location of the stations, their capacity and occupancy. The route duration and distance are obtained via the TomTom Routing API. Each user is directed to a station with the appropriate capacity in the shortest possible time. At the end of the project, the matching results are both shown on the map and recorded in log files. The codes are run via main.py, and all necessary auxiliary functions are located in the src folder. User and station data are kept in the data folder, and outputs and analyses are kept in the logs folder. In order to run the project, the necessary libraries must first be installed with requirements.txt, and then the TomTom API key must be added to the .env file. When the program is run, the most suitable station for each user is automatically determined and the results are transferred visually to the final_assignment_map.html file. The project is structured in a way that anyone with basic Python knowledge can understand.
